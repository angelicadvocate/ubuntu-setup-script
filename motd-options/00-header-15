# Instructions for Adding Custom Motivational Quotes:
#
# To add your own motivational messages, simply replace the existing entries in the 
# "messages" array, or add new ones as additional lines between the '(' and ')'.
# Each message should be a single string enclosed in double quotes.
# 
# Important: If any message exceeds 65 characters, you must manually insert a newline 
# character (`\n`) at an appropriate position to ensure it doesn't overflow when displayed.
# For example:
# "This is a motivational quote that is long enough to need splitting,\nand this is the second part."
#
# Make sure to count the characters, including spaces and punctuation. The 65-character width
# applies to each line, and lines longer than this should be broken into multiple lines using 
# `\n` at the proper point for readability.
